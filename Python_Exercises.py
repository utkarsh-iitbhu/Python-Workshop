def dictionary(d):
    
# ** Given this nested dictionary grab the word "hello". Be prepared, this will be annoying/tricky **

def domainGet(email):
    
    # ** Create a function that grabs the email website domain from a string in the form: **
# 
#     user@domain.com
#     
# **So for example, passing "user@domain.com" would return: domain.com**

    return None


def findDog(st):
    
# ** Create a basic function that returns True if the word 'dog' is contained in the input string. Don't worry about edge cases like a punctuation being attached to the word dog, but do account for capitalization. **

def countDog(st):

# ** Create a function that counts the number of times the word "dog" occurs in a string. Again ignore edge cases. **

    return None



def lambdafunc(seq):

# 
#     seq = ['soup','dog','salad','cat','great']
# 
# **should be filtered down to:**
#

    return None


def caught_speeding(speed, is_birthday):
    
    # ### Final Problem
# **You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write a function
#   to return one of 3 possible results: "No ticket", "Small ticket", or "Big Ticket". 
#   If your speed is 60 or less, the result is "No Ticket". If speed is between 61 
#   and 80 inclusive, the result is "Small Ticket". If speed is 81 or more, the result is "Big    Ticket". Unless it is your birthday (encoded as a boolean value in the parameters of the function) -- on your birthday, your speed can be 5 higher in all 
#   cases. **

    return None


# # Great job!
