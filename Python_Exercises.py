def caught_speeding(speed, is_birthday):
    
    # ### Final Problem
# **You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you. Write a function
#   to return one of 3 possible results: "No ticket", "Small ticket", or "Big Ticket". 
#   If your speed is 60 or less, the result is "No Ticket". If speed is between 61 
#   and 80 inclusive, the result is "Small Ticket". If speed is 81 or more, the result is "Big    Ticket". Unless it is your birthday (encoded as a boolean value in the parameters of the function) -- on your birthday, your speed can be 5 higher in all 
#   cases. **
